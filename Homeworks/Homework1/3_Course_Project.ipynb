It would be required that all data is hold and processed in the company's servers and network. I would also require approval for download and installation of any software.  My main concern is that it becomes too difficult to work with all these restrictions.   Additionally, I'm not sure how much of the results I would be able to share.  \n",

    "#### Idea 1: Insurance - Predicting losses (claims)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overview of your idea\n",
    "    * After working for a few years in insurance budgeting, I've seen how difficult and inaccurate is the process of forecasting claims. So far the company is using historical data of claims to calculate a claim rate for product (claims/premiums).  It could be really interesting to see what can be predicted if more variables are used to forecast claims. \n",
    "* What data you will use, and how you will collect it\n",
    "    *  Since this is a problem that actuaries have been working for a long time,  I  would expect to find papers and references on which variables to start using when predicting claims.  I could focus on one or two product and get very detailed policy data to run predictions.\n",
    "* What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve\n",
    "    * I would like to deliver a model for finance people (budgeting unit), so they can use it every time they need to reforecast claims. It cannot be too complex that they cannot understand it or explain variance between forecast and actuals later. \n",
    "* Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve\n",
    "    * Machine learning. I read it in some papers, but I really don't know :(\n",

    "\n",
    "* Overview of your idea\n",
    "    * This is a problem that has been solved using allocations so far. For instance, revenues, commission and claims for a given insurance agent is known, but expenses are always difficult to assign.  At the moment the solution is to allocate expenses proportionally to his/her sales.  It could be interesting to understand what variables explain better the expenses that an insurance agent represents to the company (i.e. his/her \"type\" of customers, renewal rate , underwriting errors, help desk usage, fraud cases, etc.)\n",
